# Image-Analysis
Image Analysis with [MicrosoftCognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/). 

This Windows 10 app uses 3 APIs included in the Microsoft Cognitive Services: Computer Vision, Bing Speech and Bing Image Search. 
Based on these APIs the user is able to search for pictures and analyse them, by clicking on one of the 4 suggestions. The chosen image is then described by Computer Vision API and the response is given via text and speech.
